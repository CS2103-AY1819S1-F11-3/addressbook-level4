== Introduction

WatchOver is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks*. More importantly, WatchOver is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, WatchOver enables you to manage your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `watchover.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your task manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks
* **`add`**`n/Do CS2103 tutorial t/02-12-18 1330 p/5 d/Do it for Jelena l/tutorial` : adds a task named `Do 2103 tutorial` to the task manager.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Count eggs`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [l/LABEL]` can be used as `n/Count eggs l/tutorial` or as `n/Count eggs`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[l/LABEL]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `l/tutorial`, `l/tutorial l/skipped` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PRIORITY_VALUE`, `p/PRIORITY_VALUE n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* `+Example` indicates positive example while `-Example` indicates negative example.

=== Task Management
// tag::add[]
==== Adding a Task: `add`
[%hardbreaks]
Adds a task to the task manager.
Format:

`add n/TASK_NAME t/DUE_DATE p/PRIORITY_VALUE [d/detailed description] [l/LABEL]`

Date Format: `dd-mm-yy hhmm` or `dd-mm-yy hhmm`. A missing `hhmm` field will cause time to
be interpreted as the start of the day, i.e `00:00`.

On task creation, the task's `INDEX` is shown as such:
```
Task <INDEX>, <TASK_NAME> was created.
```
[%hardbreaks]
+Example:
`add n/complete milestone t/14-09-19 p/99 d/a detailed description l/CS2103` +
`add n/complete milestone t/14-09-19 1320 p/9 d/a detailed description l/CS2103`

-Example:
`add n/complete milestone t/2018/09/14 p/important`
`add n/complete milestone t/2018/09/14 p/-4`

[TIP]
Duplicated tasks are not allowed in the task manager. Duplicated tasks are defined as tasks with the same name and
due date or tasks with the same name and priority value.


// end::add[]

==== Deleting a Task: `delete`
[%hardbreaks]

Format: `delete INDEX`
+Example: `delete 1`
-Example: `delete task`

==== Editing a Task: `edit`
[%hardbreaks]
Edits a task in the task manager
Format:
`edit INDEX [t/DUE_DATE] [p/PRIORITY_VALUE] [d/detailed description] [l/LABEL]`

`edit 1 t/18-12-19 d/a updated detailed description of what needs to be done`

// tag::dependency[]
==== Adding/Removing a dependency to a Task: `dependency`
[%hardbreaks]

Format:
`dependency INDEX_DEPENDANT INDEX_DEPENDEE`

+Example:
`dependency 1 2`

-Example:
`dependency 1`
`dependency a b`
// end::dependency[]


// tag::complete-usage[]
==== Completing a Task: `complete`
[%hardbreaks]

Format: `complete INDEX` or `complete t/LABEL`
+Example:
`complete 1`
`complete l/urgent`
-Example:
`complete 1 l/urgent` (Behavior is not clear)

* Completion via label is case-insensitive
* You can complete multiple tasks at once through the use of the format complete `l/LABEL`
* Note that the label needs to be valid. Validity for a label, `x`, is defined by the following
condition:
** Has at least one task which is labelled `x` and status is not "COMPLETED"
* On completion of tasks that leads to a level-up, the levelling up would be reported.
// end::complete-usage[]
==== Listing Tasks: `list`
[%hardbreaks]
Shows a list of all tasks.

Format:
`list [f/FILTER]`, where FILTER must be any of the following:

 * `today`

 * `week`

 * `month`

 * `doable`

+Example:
`list`

+Example:
`list f/today`

-Example:
`list f/alltime`
```
1. finish math tutorial  DueDate: 01-10-18 1300 Description: before exam PriorityValue: 2 Status: IN PROGRESS
2. Attack Food  DueDate: 01-10-18 Description: what did food do PriorityValue: 88 Status: FINISHED
3. Induce Happiness DueDate: 03-10-18 Description: conditions of happiness PriorityValue: 3 Status: OVERDUE
```

==== Search for Tasks by Keyword: `find`
[%hardbreaks]
Finds tasks whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `happiness` will match `Happiness`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `induce happiness` will match `happiness induce`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `ha` will not match `happiness`
* Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `attack happiness` will return
`Attack food`, `Induce happiness`
****

+Example: `find happiness`
-Example: `find OVERDUE`

==== Selecting a person : `select`

// tag::topoorder[]
==== Listing Tasks by topological order: `topoorder`
[%hardbreaks]

// end::topoorder[]

=== Gamification
// tag::achievements-usage[]
==== Display achievements across a time period: `achievements`
[%hardbreaks]
Displays the cumulative achievements of a user across a specified time period on the GUI.
Such achievements include current level, xp earned and number of tasks completed across that time period.
Users automatically level up on gaining enough xp to reach the next level. The maximum level is capped at lvl.5.
Format: `achievements TIME_SPAN`, a valid `TIME_SPAN` may take the value of `all-time`, `today`, or `this week`.

[%hardbreaks]
+Example: `achievements all-time`
+Example: `achievements today`
+Example: `achievements this week`
-Example: `achievements all time`
-Example: `achievements TODAY`

[TIP]
Today and this week's achievements assume users do not time travel. +
Once a day/week is passed, its achievements cannot be retrieved again by `achievements today/this week` if the user ever
comes back from the future.
// end::achievements-usage[]

// tag::gamemode-usage[]
==== Change game mode: `mode`
[%hardbreaks]
Changes the game mode.
The game mode determines the manner of xp award to the user. The default Flat mode awards a constant 50xp to users per task completed before the deadline, and a constant 25xp to users. In contrast, the alternate Decreasing mode instead awards a decreasing number of points according to how late the task was completed. The points awarded are at a maximum of 50 xp one week before the task is due, and reduce linearly over the week until 25 xp is awarded if the task is completed exactly at the due time. 

The game mode command is **not affected by undo/redo**, because it does not change the state of the tasks. To reverse an unintended game mode change, simply change again to the desired game mode.

Format: `mode GAME_MODE`, where a valid `GAME_MODE` can be one of `flat` or `decreasing`.

[%hardbreaks]
+Example: `mode flat`
+Example: `mode decreasing`
-Example: `mode edna`

// end::gamemode-usage[]
