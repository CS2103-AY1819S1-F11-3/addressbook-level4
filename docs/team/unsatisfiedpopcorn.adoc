== PROJECT: WatchOver

== Overview

WatchOver is a desktop Task Manager application used for learning Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *complete a task as identified by
index*, *complete a batch of tasks as identified by a label*.

** Complete a task as identified by index

*** What it does: allows the user to complete task in the task manager
*** Justification: This feature provides on of the core functionality of task
managers, marking a task as complete.

** Complete a batch of tasks as identified by a label

*** What it does: allows the user to complete a batch of task identified by
a label in the task manager atomically.
*** Justification: This feature allows for the user to convenient complete
multiple tasks at one go through the simple use of labels.
**** This present to them
a better user experience than monotonously completing tasks one by one.
**** Furthermore, as this operation is atomic to the user, if he makes a mistake in
completing the tasks he need only use the undo command once to revert changes
to the batch of tasks. He need not painstakingly undo them one by one.
*** Highlights: This enhancement required careful design considerations due to the
creation of two flavours of the complete command. Moreover, the atomicity
required from this feature required a model rollback operation that it does not
currently support. Moreover, this implementation was challenging as it required
changes to other components of the application.
**** Converting `CompleteCommand` into an abstract class in order to support the
polymorphic behaviour of the two flavour of completion. Additionally, this helps
keeps code organised neatly by following the Single Responsibility Principle.
**** Implementing a rollback operation for the model, which could possibly be
used to provide better data integrity of the application in future development.

* *Other contributions*:
** *Minor Enhancements*:
*** Extended the model to check if it is in an invalid state where completed tasks
have uncompleted dependencies. Integrated this with CompleteCommand to prevent completion of
tasks that will result in the aformentioned invalid state.
