== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 4

---

== Overview

AddressBook - Level 4 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *complete a task as identified by
index*, *complete a batch of tasks as identified by a label*.

** Complete a task as identified by index

*** What it does: allows the user to complete task in the task manager
*** Justification: This feature provides on of the core functionality of task
managers, marking a task as complete.

** Complete a batch of tasks as identified by a label

*** What it does: allows the user to complete a batch of task identified by
a label in the task manager atomically.
*** Justification: This feature allows for the user to convenient complete
multiple tasks at one go through the simple use of labels.
**** This present to them
a better user experience than monotonously completing tasks one by one.
**** Furthermore, as this operation is atomic to the user, if he makes a mistake in
completing the tasks he need only use the undo command once to revert changes
to the batch of tasks. He need not painstakingly undo them one by one.
*** Highlights: This enhancement required careful design considerations due to the
creation of two flavours of the complete command. Moreover, the atomicity
required from this feature required a model rollback operation that it does not
currently support. Moreover, this implementation was challenging as it required
changes to other components of the application.
**** Converting `CompleteCommand` into an abstract class in order to support the
polymorphic behaviour of the two flavour of completion. Additionally, this helps
keeps code organised neatly by following the Single Responsibility Principle.
**** Implementing a rollback operation for the model, which could possibly be
used to provide better data integrity of the application in future development.
