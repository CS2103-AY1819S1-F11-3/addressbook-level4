== PROJECT: WatchOver

---

== Overview

WatchOver is a gamified desktop task manager.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *game mode functionality*.
** What it does: allows the user to switch between game modes, which are schemes for awarding XP to the user in the context of the gamified task manager.
** Justification: This feature allows for a more dynamic experience tailored to each user. Different users are motivated by different kinds of reward schemes. Some users may prefer to have incentives for completing tasks earlier or later.
** Highlights: This enhancement required modifying the base model. As a result, many changes had to be made throughout the internal structure of the code. There were also significant design choices in how to implement the data structure of the game mode, in order to maximise ease of use as well as future extensibility.
