== PROJECT: WatchOver
---

== Overview

WatchOver is a gamified desktop task manager.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the achievements mechanism*
** What it does: Keeps track of the achievement information of the user and displays it on the UI.
** Justification: This enhancement lays down the basic infrastructure for the gamification component of the gamified task manager. The achievement information provides users with
incentive and motivation to complete the tasks. Daily and weekly achievement information also helps users keep track of their performances across time.
** Highlights: As the achievement information is updated per completion of task, the design of the mechanism needs to take into consideration of the undo/redo of complete commands. In depth analysis of alternative designs
is required to support such integration to keep the achievement information consistent with the actual completion of tasks. +
The support for daily, weekly achievement information also requires the achievement mechanism to have a sense of time to update and reset such time based achievement fields. +
As the achievement information is presented on the GUI rather than via the CLI on achievement commands. Design considerations are also required
to toggle back the achievement panel GUI display (e.g. from all-time to today) on undo/redo command. +
The whole mechanism requires extensive support and modification of all of the model, storage, logic and UI components of the existing software.
